Banjo
=====

Banjo is an abstraction over `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ 
which provides a simplified subset of Djangoâ€™s functionality, meant for beginners. 
Banjo makes it easy to create a server which responds to HTTP requests containing
JSON data. Banjo servers return data, not visual web pages. 

All the Django documentation can be used for reference, and many Django patterns are
replicated here.
